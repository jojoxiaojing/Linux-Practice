### The shell
One types commands to the shell, the command interpreter. It is not built-in, but is just a program and you can change your shell. The standard one is called sh. See also ash, bash, csh, zsh, chsh.

* command prompt
it is the shell's way of indicating that it is ready for the next command.
* **date** (that gives date and time)
* **cal** (that gives a calendar).
* **ls** lists the contents of the current directory
-l option it gives a long listing, that includes the owner and size and date of the file, and the permissions people have for reading and/or changing the file. 
* **cat** will show the contents of a file. (The name is from "concatenate and print")
* **cp** (from "copy") will copy a file. On the other hand, the command mv (from "move") only renames it.
* **diff** lists the differences between two files. Here there was no output because there were no differences.
* **rm** (from "remove") deletes the file, and be careful! it is gone. No wastepaper basket or anything. Deleted means lost.
* **grep** (from "g/re/p") finds occurrences of a string in one or more files.
